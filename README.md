2.  Make your desired changes.
3.  Save the file.

## 🚀 Deployment

Since EducateMe-online is a static website, deployment is as simple as hosting the project files on any web server or static site hosting service.

**Recommended Options:**
-   **GitHub Pages**: Host directly from your GitHub repository. The [Live Demo](https://sehar-1207.github.io/EducateMe-online/index.html) link above assumes it's hosted this way.
